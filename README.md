# -Student-Result-Management-System
📖 Project Description

The Student Result Management System is a simple, menu-driven Python application designed to manage student academic records. This project allows users to add, view, update, and delete student result details such as name, roll number, subject-wise marks, total marks, percentage, and grade.

The system uses basic Python concepts like dictionaries, loops, conditional statements, and functions, making it ideal for beginners who want to understand how real-world academic record systems work at a fundamental level.

This project simulates a small-scale result management system without using databases or advanced frameworks, focusing purely on logical thinking and core Python programming.
